Given an array of characters chars, compress it so that:

For each sequence of consecutive repeating characters:
If a character repeats only once, keep it as is.
If a character repeats multiple times, add the character followed by the count of its repeats.
Update the chars array directly with the compressed version and return the new length of the array.
Example: For chars = ["a", "a", "b", "b", "c", "c", "c"], the output should modify chars to ["a", "2", "b", "2", "c", "3"], and the function should return 6.

Constraints:

Use only constant extra space (no additional arrays or data structures).
