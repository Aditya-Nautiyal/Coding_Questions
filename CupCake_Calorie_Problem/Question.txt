
Marc loves cupcakes, but he also likes to stay fit. Each cupcake has a calorie count, and Marc can walk a distance to expend those calories. If Marc has eaten j cupcakes so far, after eating a cupcake with c calories he must walk at least (2 with power j) x c miles to maintain his
weight.
Example
calorie = [5, 10, 7]
If he eats the cupcakes in the order shown, the miles he will need to walk are
(2 with power 0 × 5) + (2 with power 1× 10) + (2 with power 2 × 7) = 5 +20 +28 = 53. This is not the minimum, though, so we need to test other orders of consumption. In this case, our minimum miles is calculated as (2 with power 0 × 10) + (2 with power 1 × 7) + (2 with power 2 × 5) = 10 +14 +20 = 44.
Given the individual calorie counts for each of the cupcakes, determine the minimum
number of miles Marc must walk to maintain his weight. Note that he can eat the cupcakes in any order.
